# Airbnb Seattle Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings, calendar data, and reviews from Seattle to uncover trends and insights that can aid stakeholders in making informed decisions.

### Key Questions Answered:
1. What factors influence the price of a listing?
2. Are there seasonal trends in Airbnb bookings?
3. How do customer reviews impact a listing's success?

### Insights:
- Larger properties (more bedrooms and accommodates capacity) are more expensive.
- Seasonal demand peaks lead to lower availability.
- Listings with more reviews generally have higher review scores, but exceptions exist.

### Repository Structure:
- `listings_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned data for listings.
- `calendar_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned calendar data.
- `reviews_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned reviews data.
- Analysis scripts and saved visualizations (e.g., `price_distribution.png`, `availability_over_time.png`).

### Visualizations:
Visualizations are saved as PNG files for easy reference.

### Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
